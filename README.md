OkBuck is a gradle plugin, aiming to help developers utilize the fast build 
system: [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/), based on an existing project built using gradle. This plugin lets you have both build systems work side by side.

[中文版](https://github.com/OkBuilds/OkBuck/blob/master/README-zh.md)

## Why?
Gradle is typically the default build tool for android development, and 
to migrate to buck, there is a lot of overhead, which can be difficult and 
buggy. OkBuck automates this migration with very few lines of configuration.

## Installation
In root project `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.okbuilds:okbuild-gradle-plugin:0.1.3'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.github.okbuilds.okbuck-gradle-plugin'
```

That's all for basic case, no need for any other configuration. After appling the plugin, two gradle tasks are added `okbuck` and `okbuckClean`
  +  `okbuck` will generate BUCK files
  +  `okbuckClean` will **delete all** files/dirs generated by OkBuck and BUCK

You can type `buck targets` to get a list of targets that can be build. The generated `.buckconfig.local` file will have some aiases setup to build your apps without having to type the rulename. i.e you can do things like `buck build appDebug another-appPaidRelease` etc. The plugin also generates an empty `.buckconfig` file if it does not exist. You can customize the settings in the `.buckconfig` file by using the various [options](https://buckbuild.com/concept/buckconfig.html)

## Configuration
```gradle
okbuck {
    buildToolVersion "23.0.3"
    target "android-23"
    linearAllocHardLimit = [
            app: 7194304
    ]
    primaryDexPatterns = [
            app: [
                    '^com/github/okbuilds/okbuck/example/AppShell^',
                    '^com/github/okbuilds/okbuck/example/BuildConfig^',
                    '^android/support/multidex/',
                    '^com/facebook/buck/android/support/exopackage/',
                    '^com/github/promeg/xlog_android/lib/XLogConfig^',
                    '^com/squareup/leakcanary/LeakCanary^',
            ]
    ]
    exopackage = [
            appDebug: true
    ]
    annotationProcessors = [
            "local-apt-dependency": ['com.okuilds.apt.ExampleProcessor']
    ]
    appLibDependencies = [
            'appProd': [
                    'buck-android-support',
                    'com.android.support:multidex',
                    'libraries/javalibrary:main',
                    'libraries/common:paidRelease',
            ],
            'appDev': [
                    'buck-android-support',
                    'com.android.support:multidex',
                    'libraries/javalibrary:main',
                    'libraries/common:freeDebug',
            ],
            'appDemo': [
                    'buck-android-support',
                    'com.android.support:multidex',
                    'libraries/javalibrary:main',
                    'libraries/common:paidRelease',
            ]
    ]
    buckProjects = project.subprojects
    keep = []

    experimental {
        placeholderSupport true
    }
}
```

+  `buildToolVersion` specifies the version of the Android SDK Build-tools, defaults to `23.0.3`
+  `target` specifies the Android compile sdk version, default is `android-23`
+  `linearAllocHardLimit` and `primaryDexPatterns` are maps, configuration used by buck for multidex. For more details about multidex configuration, please read the
[Multidex wiki page](https://github.com/OkBuilds/OkBuck/wiki/Multidex-Configuration-Guide), 
if you don't need multidex, you can ignore these parameters
+  `exopackage`, `appClassSource` and `appLibDependencies` are used for 
configuring buck's exopackage mode. For more details about exopackage configuration, 
please read the [Exopackage wiki page](https://github.com/OkBuilds/OkBuck/wiki/Exopackage-Configuration-Guide), if you don't need exopackage, you can ignore these parameters
+ `annotationProcessors` is used to depend on annotation processors declared locally as another gradle module in the same root project.
+  `buckProjects` is a set of projects to generate buck configs for. Default is all sub projects of the root project.
+ `keep` is a list of files to not clean up by the plugin when running `okbuckclean`. This may be useful to keep the `buck-out` folder around for faster incremental builds even when buck files are regenerated. Also useful if you want made manual modifications to some buck configuration and would like to keep it intact while regenerating the configuration for other projects.
+ `experimental` is used to enable experimental features not available in buck upstream, but available in our [fork](https://github.com/OkBuilds/buck/tree/okbuck)
 - `placeholderSupport` - Enables supprot for [manifest placeholders](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide/manifest-merger#TOC-Placeholder-support)
+ The keys used to configure various options can be either for 
 - All buildTypes and flavors i.e `app`
 - All buildTypes of a particular flavor i.e 'appDemo'
 - All flavors of a particular buildType i.e 'appDebug'
 - A particular variant (buildType + flavor combination) i,e 'appDemoRelease'

## Common Issues
+ If you use ndk filters in your build.grade, you must set the `ANDROID_NDK` environment variable pointing to your local android ndk root dir, otherwise BUCK build will fail.
+ If your project uses gradle 2.4, youneed force jdk version to 1.7, [ref1](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21212790/3077508) 
and [ref2](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18144853/3077508)
+ OkBuck aims to provide almost all the features that the android gradle plugin provides,but your project may still be incompatible with buck for various reasons listed on the [Known caveats wiki page](https://github.com/OkBuilds/OkBuck/wiki/Known-caveats). 

## Compatibility
OkBuck is tested under `gradle` 2.2.1 ~ 2.13, and `com.android.tools.build:gradle` 1.5.0 ~ 2.1.0.
If other versions have any compatibility problems, please file an issue.
